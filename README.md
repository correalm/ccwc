# This is a implementation of (`wc Coding Challenge`)[https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc]

## The goal is learn Go. The code is bad, for now.

> How run? `go run main.go [args] filename` (I now this is bad, but it will get better)

### TODOS:
    - Testing
    - Split functions
    - Maybe use goroutines to improve the performance
